<p>Welcome to <b>CodeSmuzi</b>!</p>

<p>My name is Volodymyr Baranchuk. I'm a software developer and author of this blog. At the moment of writing I have over <b>5 years</b> of experience and a bunch of interesting and complex projects behind.</p>

<p>My main area of expertise is <b>Web UI Software Development</b>. However, I love learning new topics and tools that are not directly connected to front-end.</p>

<p>Since I don't have a degree in computer science, now I'm trying to catch up on everything that I've missed in the world of programming. This blog serves as a personal notebook where I'm keeping my notes, coding tips, tutorials, best practices and techniques, breakdowns of algorithms and data structures.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that writing a blog has lots of positive effects, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>deeper understanding of a topic;</li>
  <li>easier memorization;</li>
  <li>vocabulary expansion;</li>
  <li>self-discipline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides, I sincerely hope that this blog will also prove useful to someone other than myself.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about me or the idea behind this blog, please refer to my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/welcome">welcoming post</a>.</p>
