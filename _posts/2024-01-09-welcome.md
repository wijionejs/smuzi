I'm not expecting any readers, so I would be really surprised if you're reading this. Anyway, hello and welcome. For starters, let me introduce myself and explain what this blog is about.

## Intro

My name is Volodymyr Baranchuk, I'm 26 years old. There is nothing special about me, I had pretty common childhood: school, fights, football, friends and so on. I didn't have lots of interest in programming before my 20s.
